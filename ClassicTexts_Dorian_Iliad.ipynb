      "\n",
      "\"not at all,\" answered lord henry, \"not at all, my dear basil.  you\n",

      "it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.  i\n",
      "never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what i am doing.\n",
      "when we meet--we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go\n",
      "down to the duke's--we tell each other the most absurd stories with the\n",
      "most serious faces.  my wife is very good at it--much better, in fact,\n",
      "than i am.  she never gets confused over her dates, and i always do.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i hate the way you talk about your married life, harry,\" said basil\n",
      "hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden.  \"i\n",
      "believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are\n",
      "thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues.  you are an extraordinary\n",
      "fellow.  you never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\n",
      "your cynicism is simply a pose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose i know,\"\n",
      "cried lord henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the\n",
      "garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that\n",
      "stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush.  the sunlight slipped over\n",
      "the polished leaves.  in the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "after a pause, lord henry pulled out his watch.  \"i am afraid i must be\n",

      "answering a question i put to you some time ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what is that?\" said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i do not, harry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"well, i will tell you what it is.  i want you to explain to me why you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i told you the real reason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"no, you did not.  you said it was because there was too much of\n",
      "yourself in it.  now, that is childish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"harry,\" said basil hallward, looking him straight in the face, \"every\n",
      "portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not\n",
      "of the sitter.  the sitter is merely the accident, the occasion.  it is\n",
      "not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on\n",
      "the coloured canvas, reveals himself.  the reason i will not exhibit\n",
      "this picture is that i am afraid that i have shown in it the secret of\n",
      "my own soul.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "lord henry laughed.  \"and what is that?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i will tell you,\" said hallward; but an expression of perplexity came\n",
      "over his face.\n",

      "\n",

      "hardly believe it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "lord henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from\n",
      "the grass and examined it.  \"i am quite sure i shall understand it,\" he\n",
      "replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,\n",

      "\n",
      "the wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy\n",

      "languid air.  a grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a\n",
      "blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze\n",
      "wings.  lord henry felt as if he could hear basil hallward's heart\n",
      "beating, and wondered what was coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the story is simply this,\" said the painter after some time.  \"two\n",
      "months ago i went to a crush at lady brandon's. you know we poor\n",
      "artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\n",
      "remind the public that we are not savages.  with an evening coat and a\n",
      "white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain\n",
      "a reputation for being civilized.  well, after i had been in the room\n",
      "about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious\n",
      "academicians, i suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at\n",
      "me.  i turned half-way round and saw dorian gray for the first time.\n",
      "when our eyes met, i felt that i was growing pale.  a curious sensation\n",
      "of terror came over me.  i knew that i had come face to face with some\n",
      "one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if i allowed it to\n",
      "do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art\n",
      "itself.  i did not want any external influence in my life.  you know\n",
      "yourself, harry, how independent i am by nature.  i have always been my\n",
      "own master; had at least always been so, till i met dorian gray.\n",
      "then--but i don't know how to explain it to you.  something seemed to\n",
      "tell me that i was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life.  i had\n",
      "a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and\n",
      "exquisite sorrows.  i grew afraid and turned to quit the room.  it was\n",
      "not conscience that made me do so:  it was a sort of cowardice.  i take\n",
      "no credit to myself for trying to escape.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"conscience and cowardice are really the same things, basil.\n",
      "conscience is the trade-name of the firm.  that is all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i don't believe that, harry, and i don't believe you do either.\n",
      "however, whatever was my motive--and it may have been pride, for i used\n",
      "to be very proud--i certainly struggled to the door.  there, of course,\n",
      "i stumbled against lady brandon.  'you are not going to run away so\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i could not get rid of her.  she brought me up to royalties, and\n",
      "people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras\n",
      "and parrot noses.  she spoke of me as her dearest friend.  i had only\n",
      "met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me.  i\n",
      "believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at\n",
      "least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the\n",
      "nineteenth-century standard of immortality.  suddenly i found myself\n",
      "face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely\n",
      "stirred me.  we were quite close, almost touching.  our eyes met again.\n",
      "it was reckless of me, but i asked lady brandon to introduce me to him.\n",
      "perhaps it was not so reckless, after all.  it was simply inevitable.\n",
      "we would have spoken to each other without any introduction.  i am sure\n",
      "of that.  dorian told me so afterwards.  he, too, felt that we were\n",
      "destined to know each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and how did lady brandon describe this wonderful young man?\" asked his\n",
      "companion.  \"i know she goes in for giving a rapid _precis_ of all her\n",
      "guests.  i remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old\n",
      "gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my\n",
      "ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to\n",
      "everybody in the room, the most astounding details.  i simply fled.  i\n",
      "like to find out people for myself.  but lady brandon treats her guests\n",
      "exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods.  she either explains them\n",

      "school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic\n",
      "spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is greek.  the harmony of\n",
      "soul and body--how much that is!  we in our madness have separated the\n",
      "two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is\n",
      "void.  harry! if you only knew what dorian gray is to me!  you remember\n",
      "that landscape of mine, for which agnew offered me such a huge price\n",

      "of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty.  that\n",
      "accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate\n",
      "ourselves.  in the wild struggle for existence, we want to have\n",

      "well-informed man--that is the modern ideal.  and the mind of the\n",
      "thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing.  it is like a\n",

      "you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little\n",
      "out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of colour, or something.\n",
      "you will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think\n",
      "that he has behaved very badly to you.  the next time he calls, you\n",
      "will be perfectly cold and indifferent.  it will be a great pity, for\n",
      "it will alter you.  what you have told me is quite a romance, a romance\n",
      "of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind\n",

      "\n",

      "seemed to him.  one's own soul, and the passions of one's\n",
      "friends--those were the fascinating things in life.  he pictured to\n",
      "himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed\n",

      "necessity for model lodging-houses. each class would have preached the\n",
      "importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity\n",
      "in their own lives.  the rich would have spoken on the value of thrift,\n",
      "and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour.  it was\n",

      "state that she never told me he was good-looking. women have no\n",
      "appreciation of good looks; at least, good women have not.  she said\n",

      "perfume as if it had been wine.  he came close to him and put his hand\n",
      "upon his shoulder.  \"you are quite right to do that,\" he murmured.\n",

      "something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating.\n",
      "his cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm.  they\n",
      "moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their\n",
      "own.  but he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid.  why had\n",
      "it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself?  he had known\n",
      "basil hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never\n",
      "altered him.  suddenly there had come some one across his life who\n",
      "seemed to have disclosed to him life's mystery.  and, yet, what was\n",
      "there to be afraid of?  he was not a schoolboy or a girl.  it was\n",
      "absurd to be frightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"let us go and sit in the shade,\" said lord henry.  \"parker has brought\n",
      "out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be\n",
      "quite spoiled, and basil will never paint you again.  you really must\n",
      "not allow yourself to become sunburnt.  it would be unbecoming.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what can it matter?\" cried dorian gray, laughing, as he sat down on\n",
      "the seat at the end of the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it should matter everything to you, mr. gray.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing\n",

      "\"i don't feel that, lord henry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"no, you don't feel it now.  some day, when you are old and wrinkled\n",
      "and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and\n",
      "passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you\n",
      "will feel it terribly.  now, wherever you go, you charm the world.\n",
      "will it always be so? ... you have a wonderfully beautiful face, mr.\n",
      "gray.  don't frown.  you have.  and beauty is a form of genius--is\n",
      "higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation.  it is of the\n",
      "great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the\n",
      "reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon.  it\n",
      "cannot be questioned.  it has its divine right of sovereignty.  it\n",
      "makes princes of those who have it.  you smile?  ah! when you have lost\n",
      "it you won't smile.... people say sometimes that beauty is only\n",
      "superficial.  that may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as\n",

      "the world is the visible, not the invisible.... yes, mr. gray, the\n",
      "gods have been good to you.  but what the gods give they quickly take\n",
      "away.  you have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly,\n",
      "and fully.  when your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then\n",
      "you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or\n",
      "have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of\n",
      "your past will make more bitter than defeats.  every month as it wanes\n",
      "brings you nearer to something dreadful.  time is jealous of you, and\n",
      "wars against your lilies and your roses.  you will become sallow, and\n",
      "hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed.  you will suffer horribly.... ah!\n",
      "realize your youth while you have it.  don't squander the gold of your\n",

      "world belongs to you for a season.... the moment i met you i saw that\n",
      "you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really\n",
      "might be.  there was so much in you that charmed me that i felt i must\n",
      "tell you something about yourself.  i thought how tragic it would be if\n",
      "you were wasted.  for there is such a little time that your youth will\n",
      "last--such a little time.  the common hill-flowers wither, but they\n",
      "blossom again.  the laburnum will be as yellow next june as it is now.\n",
      "in a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after\n",
      "year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars.  but we\n",

      "hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were\n",
      "too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the\n",
      "courage to yield to.  youth!  youth!  there is absolutely nothing in\n",
      "the world but youth!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "dorian gray listened, open-eyed and wondering.  the spray of lilac fell\n",
      "from his hand upon the gravel.  a furry bee came and buzzed round it\n",
      "for a moment.  then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated\n",
      "globe of the tiny blossoms.  he watched it with that strange interest\n",
      "in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import\n",

      "long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.\n",
      "\n",
      "lord henry came over and examined the picture.  it was certainly a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"my dear fellow, i congratulate you most warmly,\" he said.  \"it is the\n",

      "flushed for a moment with pleasure.  a look of joy came into his eyes,\n",
      "as if he had recognized himself for the first time.  he stood there\n",
      "motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that hallward was speaking to\n",
      "him, but not catching the meaning of his words.  the sense of his own\n",
      "beauty came on him like a revelation.  he had never felt it before.\n",
      "basil hallward's compliments had seemed to him to be merely the\n",
      "charming exaggeration of friendship.  he had listened to them, laughed\n",
      "at them, forgotten them.  they had not influenced his nature.  then had\n",
      "come lord henry wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his\n",
      "terrible warning of its brevity.  that had stirred him at the time, and\n",
      "now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full\n",
      "reality of the description flashed across him.  yes, there would be a\n",
      "day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and\n",
      "colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed.  the scarlet\n",
      "would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair.  the\n",
      "life that was to make his soul would mar his body.  he would become\n",
      "dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "as he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a\n",
      "knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver.  his eyes\n",
      "deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears.  he felt\n",
      "as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"don't you like it?\" cried hallward at last, stung a little by the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"of course he likes it,\" said lord henry.  \"who wouldn't like it?  it\n",

      "dreadful.  but this picture will remain always young.  it will never be\n",
      "older than this particular day of june.... if it were only the other\n",
      "way!  if it were i who was to be always young, and the picture that was\n",

      "\n",
      "the painter stared in amazement.  it was so unlike dorian to speak like\n",

      "he played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and\n",
      "transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent\n",
      "with fancy and winged it with paradox.  the praise of folly, as he went\n",
      "on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and\n",
      "catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her\n",
      "wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a bacchante over the\n",
      "hills of life, and mocked the slow silenus for being sober.  facts fled\n",
      "before her like frightened forest things.  her white feet trod the huge\n",
      "press at which wise omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round\n",
      "her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over\n",
      "the vat's black, dripping, sloping sides.  it was an extraordinary\n",
      "improvisation.  he felt that the eyes of dorian gray were fixed on him,\n",
      "and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose\n",
      "temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and\n",
      "to lend colour to his imagination.  he was brilliant, fantastic,\n",
      "irresponsible.  he charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they\n",
      "followed his pipe, laughing.  dorian gray never took his gaze off him,\n",
      "but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips\n",

      "at last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room\n",

      "\n",
      "\"what a place to find one's divinity in!\" said lord henry.\n",

      "\"yes!\" answered dorian gray.  \"it was here i found her, and she is\n",
      "divine beyond all living things.  when she acts, you will forget\n",
      "everything.  these common rough people, with their coarse faces and\n",
      "brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage.  they\n",
      "sit silently and watch her.  they weep and laugh as she wills them to\n",
      "do.  she makes them as responsive as a violin.  she spiritualizes them,\n",

      "him.  drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves\n",

      "anodyne for his pain.  he followed into the market and watched the men\n",
      "unloading their waggons.  a white-smocked carter offered him some\n",
      "cherries.  he thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money\n",

      "jade-green piles of vegetables.  under the portico, with its grey,\n",
      "sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,\n",
      "waiting for the auction to be over.  others crowded round the swinging\n",
      "doors of the coffee-house in the piazza.  the heavy cart-horses slipped\n",
      "and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.\n",
      "some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks.  iris-necked\n",
      "and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "after a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home.  for a few\n",

      "square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.\n",
      "the sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like\n",
      "silver against it.  from some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke\n",
      "was rising.  it curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.\n",
      "\n",
      "in the huge gilt venetian lantern, spoil of some doge's barge, that\n",
      "hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance,\n",
      "lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals\n",
      "of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire.  he turned them out and,\n",
      "having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library\n",
      "towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the\n",
      "ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had\n",
      "decorated for himself and hung with some curious renaissance tapestries\n",
      "that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at selby royal.  as\n",
      "he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait\n",
      "basil hallward had painted of him.  he started back as if in surprise.\n",
      "then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled.  after he\n",
      "had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.\n",
      "finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it.  in\n",
      "the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk\n",
      "blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed.  the\n",
      "expression looked different.  one would have said that there was a\n",
      "touch of cruelty in the mouth.  it was certainly strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "he turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind.  the\n",
      "bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky\n",
      "corners, where they lay shuddering.  but the strange expression that he\n",
      "had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be\n",
      "more intensified even.  the quivering ardent sunlight showed him the\n",
      "lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking\n",
      "into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "he winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory\n",
      "cupids, one of lord henry's many presents to him, glanced hurriedly\n",
      "into its polished depths.  no line like that warped his red lips.  what\n",
      "did it mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "he rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it\n",
      "again.  there were no signs of any change when he looked into the\n",
      "actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression\n",
      "had altered.  it was not a mere fancy of his own.  the thing was\n",
      "horribly apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "he threw himself into a chair and began to think.  suddenly there\n",
      "flashed across his mind what he had said in basil hallward's studio the\n",
      "day the picture had been finished.  yes, he remembered it perfectly.\n",
      "he had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the\n",
      "portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the\n",
      "face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that\n",
      "the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and\n",
      "thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness\n",
      "of his then just conscious boyhood.  surely his wish had not been\n",
      "fulfilled?  such things were impossible.  it seemed monstrous even to\n",
      "think of them.  and, yet, there was the picture before him, with the\n",
      "touch of cruelty in the mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "cruelty!  had he been cruel?  it was the girl's fault, not his.  he had\n",
      "dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he\n",
      "had thought her great.  then she had disappointed him.  she had been\n",
      "shallow and unworthy.  and, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over\n",
      "him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little\n",
      "child.  he remembered with what callousness he had watched her.  why\n",
      "had he been made like that?  why had such a soul been given to him?\n",
      "but he had suffered also.  during the three terrible hours that the\n",
      "play had lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of\n",
      "torture.  his life was well worth hers.  she had marred him for a\n",
      "moment, if he had wounded her for an age.  besides, women were better\n",
      "suited to bear sorrow than men.  they lived on their emotions.  they\n",
      "only thought of their emotions.  when they took lovers, it was merely\n",
      "to have some one with whom they could have scenes.  lord henry had told\n",
      "him that, and lord henry knew what women were.  why should he trouble\n",
      "about sibyl vane?  she was nothing to him now.\n",
      "\n",
      "but the picture?  what was he to say of that?  it held the secret of\n",
      "his life, and told his story.  it had taught him to love his own\n",
      "beauty.  would it teach him to loathe his own soul?  would he ever look\n",
      "at it again?\n",
      "\n",
      "no; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses.  the\n",
      "horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it.\n",
      "suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that\n",
      "makes men mad.  the picture had not changed.  it was folly to think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel\n",
      "smile.  its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight.  its blue eyes\n",
      "met his own.  a sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the\n",
      "painted image of himself, came over him.  it had altered already, and\n",
      "would alter more.  its gold would wither into grey.  its red and white\n",
      "roses would die.  for every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck\n",
      "and wreck its fairness.  but he would not sin.  the picture, changed or\n",
      "unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience.  he would\n",
      "resist temptation.  he would not see lord henry any more--would not, at\n",
      "any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil\n",
      "hallward's garden had first stirred within him the passion for\n",
      "impossible things.  he would go back to sibyl vane, make her amends,\n",
      "marry her, try to love her again.  yes, it was his duty to do so.  she\n",
      "must have suffered more than he had.  poor child!  he had been selfish\n",
      "and cruel to her.  the fascination that she had exercised over him\n",

      "way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was\n",
      "wandering.  he did not know what to do, or what to think.  finally, he\n",

      "\n",

      "in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel\n",
      "with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was\n",

      "forgotten something upstairs.  they waited some time for her, but she\n",
      "did not come down again.  they ultimately found her lying dead on the\n",
      "floor of her dressing-room. she had swallowed something by mistake,\n",
      "some dreadful thing they use at theatres.  i don't know what it was,\n",
      "but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it.  i should fancy it\n",

      "she explained it all to me.  it was terribly pathetic.  but i was not\n",
      "moved a bit.  i thought her shallow.  suddenly something happened that\n",
      "made me afraid.  i can't tell you what it was, but it was terrible.  i\n",

      "dead.  my god!  my god!  harry, what shall i do?  you don't know the\n",
      "danger i am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight.  she would\n",

      "and looking horribly pale.  \"but i thought it was my duty.  it is not\n",
      "my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was\n",

      "\"good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific\n",

      "they give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions\n",
      "that have a certain charm for the weak.  that is all that can be said\n",

      "like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play.  it has all the terrible\n",
      "beauty of a greek tragedy, a tragedy in which i took a great part, but\n",
      "by which i have not been wounded.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is an interesting question,\" said lord henry, who found an\n",
      "exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism, \"an\n",
      "extremely interesting question.  i fancy that the true explanation is\n",
      "this:  it often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such\n",
      "an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their\n",
      "absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack\n",
      "of style.  they affect us just as vulgarity affects us.  they give us\n",
      "an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that.\n",
      "sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of\n",
      "beauty crosses our lives.  if these elements of beauty are real, the\n",
      "whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect.  suddenly\n",
      "we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the\n",
      "play.  or rather we are both.  we watch ourselves, and the mere wonder\n",
      "of the spectacle enthralls us.  in the present case, what is it that\n",
      "has really happened?  some one has killed herself for love of you.  i\n",
      "wish that i had ever had such an experience.  it would have made me in\n",
      "love with love for the rest of my life.  the people who have adored\n",
      "me--there have not been very many, but there have been some--have\n",
      "always insisted on living on, long after i had ceased to care for them,\n",
      "or they to care for me.  they have become stout and tedious, and when i\n",
      "meet them, they go in at once for reminiscences.  that awful memory of\n",
      "woman!  what a fearful thing it is!  and what an utter intellectual\n",
      "stagnation it reveals!  one should absorb the colour of life, but one\n",
      "should never remember its details.  details are always vulgar.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "mourning for a romance that would not die.  ultimately, however, it did\n",
      "die.  i forget what killed it.  i think it was her proposing to\n",

      "strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "dorian, from the moment i met you, your personality had the most\n",
      "extraordinary influence over me.  i was dominated, soul, brain, and\n",
      "power, by you.  you became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen\n",
      "ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream.  i\n",
      "worshipped you.  i grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke.  i\n",
      "wanted to have you all to myself.  i was only happy when i was with\n",
      "you.  when you were away from me, you were still present in my art....\n",
      "of course, i never let you know anything about this.  it would have\n",
      "been impossible.  you would not have understood it.  i hardly\n",
      "understood it myself.  i only knew that i had seen perfection face to\n",
      "face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes--too\n",
      "wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the peril\n",
      "of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them....  weeks and\n",
      "weeks went on, and i grew more and more absorbed in you.  then came a\n",
      "new development.  i had drawn you as paris in dainty armour, and as\n",
      "adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. crowned with\n",
      "heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of adrian's barge, gazing\n",
      "across the green turbid nile.  you had leaned over the still pool of\n",
      "some greek woodland and seen in the water's silent silver the marvel of\n",
      "your own face.  and it had all been what art should be--unconscious,\n",
      "ideal, and remote.  one day, a fatal day i sometimes think, i\n",
      "determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are,\n",
      "not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own\n",
      "time.  whether it was the realism of the method, or the mere wonder of\n",
      "your own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or\n",
      "veil, i cannot tell.  but i know that as i worked at it, every flake\n",
      "and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret.  i grew afraid\n",
      "that others would know of my idolatry.  i felt, dorian, that i had told\n",
      "too much, that i had put too much of myself into it.  then it was that\n",
      "i resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited.  you were a\n",
      "little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me.\n",
      "harry, to whom i talked about it, laughed at me.  but i did not mind\n",
      "that.  when the picture was finished, and i sat alone with it, i felt\n",
      "that i was right.... well, after a few days the thing left my studio,\n",
      "and as soon as i had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its\n",
      "presence, it seemed to me that i had been foolish in imagining that i\n",
      "had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking\n",
      "and that i could paint.  even now i cannot help feeling that it is a\n",
      "mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really\n",
      "shown in the work one creates.  art is always more abstract than we\n",
      "fancy.  form and colour tell us of form and colour--that is all.  it\n",
      "often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than\n",
      "it ever reveals him.  and so when i got this offer from paris, i\n",
      "determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.\n",
      "it never occurred to me that you would refuse.  i see now that you were\n",
      "right.  the picture cannot be shown.  you must not be angry with me,\n",
      "dorian, for what i have told you.  as i said to harry, once, you are\n",
      "made to be worshipped.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "dorian gray drew a long breath.  the colour came back to his cheeks,\n",
      "and a smile played about his lips.  the peril was over.  he was safe\n",
      "for the time.  yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the\n",
      "painter who had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered\n",
      "if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a\n",
      "friend.  lord henry had the charm of being very dangerous.  but that\n",
      "was all.  he was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of.\n",
      "would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange\n",
      "idolatry?  was that one of the things that life had in store?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is extraordinary to me, dorian,\" said hallward, \"that you should\n",

      "\n",
      "\"well, you don't mind my looking at the thing now?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"it was not intended as a compliment.  it was a confession.  now that i\n",

      "we must always remain so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you have got harry,\" said the painter sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh, harry!\" cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter.  \"harry spends\n",
      "his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is\n",
      "improbable.  just the sort of life i would like to lead.  but still i\n",

      "blue eyes, and rose-red lips--they all were there.  it was simply the\n",

      "of all that was in store for him!\n",

      "yes, it was dorian himself.  but who had done it?  he seemed to\n",

      "own picture!  what did it mean?  why had it altered?  he turned and\n",
      "looked at dorian gray with the eyes of a sick man.  his mouth twitched,\n",

      "real sorrow in it nor real joy.  there was simply the passion of the\n",

      "the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so.\n",

      "surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it.  it was\n",
      "from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come.\n",

      "wash away our iniquities.'  let us say that together.  the prayer of\n",
      "your pride has been answered.  the prayer of your repentance will be\n",
      "answered also.  i worshipped you too much.  i am punished for it.  you\n",
      "worshipped yourself too much.  we are both punished.\"\n",

      "more than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything.  he glanced\n",
      "wildly around.  something glimmered on the top of the painted chest\n",
      "that faced him.  his eye fell on it.  he knew what it was.  it was a\n",

      "things that he had required for his dreadful work.  he began to wonder\n",

      "precious.  her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.\n",

      "drove back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror\n",
      "he thought he had strangled had come back to him.  lord henry's casual\n",
      "questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted\n",
      "his nerve still.  things that were dangerous had to be destroyed.  he\n",
      "winced.  he hated the idea of even touching them.\n",
      "\n",
      "yet it had to be done.  he realized that, and when he had locked the\n",
      "door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had\n",
      "thrust basil hallward's coat and bag.  a huge fire was blazing.  he\n",
      "piled another log on it.  the smell of the singeing clothes and burning\n",
      "leather was horrible.  it took him three-quarters of an hour to consume\n",
      "everything.  at the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some\n",
      "algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and\n",
      "forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.\n",
      "\n",
      "suddenly he started.  his eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed\n",
      "nervously at his underlip.  between two of the windows stood a large\n",
      "florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue\n",
      "lapis.  he watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate\n",
      "and make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet\n",
      "almost loathed.  his breath quickened.  a mad craving came over him.\n",
      "he lit a cigarette and then threw it away.  his eyelids drooped till\n",
      "the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek.  but he still watched\n",
      "the cabinet.  at last he got up from the sofa on which he had been\n",
      "lying, went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden\n",
      "spring.  a triangular drawer passed slowly out.  his fingers moved\n",
      "instinctively towards it, dipped in, and closed on something.  it was a\n",
      "small chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought,\n",
      "the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with\n",
      "round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads.  he opened it.\n",
      "inside was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and\n",
      "persistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "he hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his\n",
      "face.  then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly\n",
      "hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock.  it was twenty\n",
      "minutes to twelve.  he put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as\n",
      "he did so, and went into his bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "as midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, dorian gray,\n",
      "dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept\n",
      "quietly out of his house.  in bond street he found a hansom with a good\n",
      "horse.  he hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address.\n",

      "man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile.  a steam rose from\n",
      "the horse as it splashed up the puddles.  the sidewindows of the hansom\n",

      "\n",
      "\"to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of\n",

      "blood had been spilled.  what could atone for that?  ah! for that there\n",

      "indeed, what right had basil to have spoken to him as he had done?  who\n",

      "\n",
      "on and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each\n",

      "the hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him.  his throat burned\n",

      "then they passed by lonely brickfields.  the fog was lighter here, and\n",
      "he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange,\n",
      "fanlike tongues of fire.  a dog barked as they went by, and far away in\n",

      "ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real,\n",

      "after a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being\n",
      "unhooked.  the door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a\n",
      "word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the\n",
      "shadow as he passed.  at the end of the hall hung a tattered green\n",
      "curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him\n",

      "it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had\n",

      "beaters ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns\n",
      "that followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful\n",

      "high indifference of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front\n",

      "\n",
      "\"what nonsense, dorian!\" laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded\n",
      "into the thicket, he fired.  there were two cries heard, the cry of a\n",
      "hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is\n",
      "worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"good heavens!  i have hit a beater!\" exclaimed sir geoffrey.  \"what an\n",

      "\n",
      "the head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"where, sir?  where is he?\" he shouted.  at the same time, the firing\n",
      "ceased along the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"here,\" answered sir geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.\n",
      "\"why on earth don't you keep your men back?  spoiled my shooting for\n",
      "the day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the\n",
      "lithe swinging branches aside.  in a few moments they emerged, dragging\n",
      "a body after them into the sunlight.  he turned away in horror.  it\n",
      "seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went.  he heard sir\n",
      "geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of\n",
      "the keeper.  the wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with\n",
      "faces.  there was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of\n",
      "voices.  a great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the\n",
      "boughs overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "after a few moments--that were to him, in his perturbed state, like\n",

      "\n",
      "\"dorian,\" said lord henry, \"i had better tell them that the shooting is\n",

      "\n",
      "they walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly\n",

      "\n",
      "\"what is?\" asked lord henry.  \"oh! this accident, i suppose.  my dear\n",
      "fellow, it can't be helped.  it was the man's own fault.  why did he\n",
      "get in front of the guns?  besides, it is nothing to us.  it is rather\n",
      "awkward for geoffrey, of course.  it does not do to pepper beaters.  it\n",
      "makes people think that one is a wild shot.  and geoffrey is not; he\n",
      "shoots very straight.  but there is no use talking about the matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "dorian shook his head.  \"it is a bad omen, harry.  i feel as if\n",
      "something horrible were going to happen to some of us.  to myself,\n",
      "perhaps,\" he added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of\n",
      "pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "the elder man laughed.  \"the only horrible thing in the world is _ennui_,\n",
      "dorian.  that is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.  but we\n",
      "are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering\n",
      "about this thing at dinner.  i must tell them that the subject is to be\n",
      "tabooed.  as for omens, there is no such thing as an omen.  destiny\n",
      "does not send us heralds.  she is too wise or too cruel for that.\n",
      "besides, what on earth could happen to you, dorian?  you have\n",
      "everything in the world that a man can want.  there is no one who would\n",
      "not be delighted to change places with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"there is no one with whom i would not change places, harry.  don't\n",
      "laugh like that.  i am telling you the truth.  the wretched peasant who\n",
      "has just died is better off than i am.  i have no terror of death.  it\n",
      "is the coming of death that terrifies me.  its monstrous wings seem to\n",
      "wheel in the leaden air around me.  good heavens! don't you see a man\n",
      "moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "lord henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand\n",
      "was pointing.  \"yes,\" he said, smiling, \"i see the gardener waiting for\n",
      "you.  i suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on\n",
      "the table to-night. how absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow!  you\n",
      "must come and see my doctor, when we get back to town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching.  the\n",
      "man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at lord henry in a hesitating\n",
      "manner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to his master.\n",
      "\"her grace told me to wait for an answer,\" he murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "dorian put the letter into his pocket.  \"tell her grace that i am\n",
      "coming in,\" he said, coldly.  the man turned round and went rapidly in\n",
      "the direction of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"how fond women are of doing dangerous things!\" laughed lord henry.\n",
      "\"it is one of the qualities in them that i admire most.  a woman will\n",
      "flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"how fond you are of saying dangerous things, harry!  in the present\n",
      "instance, you are quite astray.  i like the duchess very much, but i\n",
      "don't love her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you\n",
      "are excellently matched.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you are talking scandal, harry, and there is never any basis for\n",
      "scandal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,\" said lord henry,\n",
      "lighting a cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you would sacrifice anybody, harry, for the sake of an epigram.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the world goes to the altar of its own accord,\" was the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i wish i could love,\" cried dorian gray with a deep note of pathos in\n",
      "his voice.  \"but i seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the\n",
      "desire.  i am too much concentrated on myself.  my own personality has\n",
      "become a burden to me.  i want to escape, to go away, to forget.  it\n",
      "was silly of me to come down here at all.  i think i shall send a wire\n",
      "to harvey to have the yacht got ready.  on a yacht one is safe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"safe from what, dorian?  you are in some trouble.  why not tell me\n",
      "what it is?  you know i would help you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i can't tell you, harry,\" he answered sadly.  \"and i dare say it is\n",
      "only a fancy of mine.  this unfortunate accident has upset me.  i have\n",
      "a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what nonsense!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i hope it is, but i can't help feeling it.  ah! here is the duchess,\n",
      "looking like artemis in a tailor-made gown.  you see we have come back,\n",
      "duchess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i have heard all about it, mr. gray,\" she answered.  \"poor geoffrey is\n",
      "terribly upset.  and it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare.\n",
      "how curious!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"yes, it was very curious.  i don't know what made me say it.  some\n",
      "whim, i suppose.  it looked the loveliest of little live things.  but i\n",
      "am sorry they told you about the man.  it is a hideous subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"it is an annoying subject,\" broke in lord henry.  \"it has no\n",
      "psychological value at all.  now if geoffrey had done the thing on\n",
      "purpose, how interesting he would be!  i should like to know some one\n",
      "who had committed a real murder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"how horrid of you, harry!\" cried the duchess.  \"isn't it, mr. gray?\n",
      "harry, mr. gray is ill again.  he is going to faint.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i have not the slightest idea.  if basil chooses to hide himself, it\n",

      "him.  death is the only thing that ever terrifies me.  i hate it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why?\" said the younger man wearily.\n",

      "\"because,\" said lord henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt\n",
      "trellis of an open vinaigrette box, \"one can survive everything\n",
      "nowadays except that.  death and vulgarity are the only two facts in\n",
      "the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away.  let us have our\n",
      "coffee in the music-room, dorian.  you must play chopin to me.  the man\n",
      "with whom my wife ran away played chopin exquisitely.  poor victoria!\n",
      "i was very fond of her.  the house is rather lonely without her.  of\n",
      "course, married life is merely a habit, a bad habit.  but then one\n",

      "the most.  they are such an essential part of one's personality.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next\n",
      "room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white\n",
      "and black ivory of the keys.  after the coffee had been brought in, he\n",
      "stopped, and looking over at lord henry, said, \"harry, did it ever\n",
      "occur to you that basil was murdered?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "lord henry yawned.  \"basil was very popular, and always wore a\n",
      "waterbury watch.  why should he have been murdered?  he was not clever\n",
      "enough to have enemies.  of course, he had a wonderful genius for\n",
      "painting.  but a man can paint like velasquez and yet be as dull as\n",
      "possible.  basil was really rather dull.  he only interested me once,\n",
      "and that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration\n",
      "for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i was very fond of basil,\" said dorian with a note of sadness in his\n",
      "voice.  \"but don't people say that he was murdered?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh, some of the papers do.  it does not seem to me to be at all\n",
      "probable.  i know there are dreadful places in paris, but basil was not\n",
      "the sort of man to have gone to them.  he had no curiosity.  it was his\n",
      "chief defect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what would you say, harry, if i told you that i had murdered basil?\"\n",
      "said the younger man.  he watched him intently after he had spoken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that\n",
      "doesn't suit you.  all crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.\n",
      "it is not in you, dorian, to commit a murder.  i am sorry if i hurt\n",
      "your vanity by saying so, but i assure you it is true.  crime belongs\n",
      "exclusively to the lower orders.  i don't blame them in the smallest\n",
      "degree.  i should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us,\n",
      "simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"a method of procuring sensations?  do you think, then, that a man who\n",

      "don't tell me that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,\" cried lord\n",
      "henry, laughing.  \"that is one of the most important secrets of life.\n",
      "i should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake.  one should\n",
      "never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner.  but let us\n",
      "pass from poor basil.  i wish i could believe that he had come to such\n",
      "a really romantic end as you suggest, but i can't. i dare say he fell\n",
      "into the seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the\n",
      "scandal.  yes:  i should fancy that was his end.  i see him lying now\n",
      "on his back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges\n",
      "floating over him and long weeds catching in his hair.  do you know, i\n",
      "don't think he would have done much more good work.  during the last\n",
      "ten years his painting had gone off very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "dorian heaved a sigh, and lord henry strolled across the room and began\n",
      "to stroke the head of a curious java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged\n",
      "bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo\n",
      "perch.  as his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf\n",
      "of crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards\n",
      "and forwards.\n",

      "\"yes,\" he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of\n",
      "his pocket; \"his painting had quite gone off.  it seemed to me to have\n",
      "lost something.  it had lost an ideal.  when you and he ceased to be\n",
      "great friends, he ceased to be a great artist.  what was it separated\n",
      "you?  i suppose he bored you.  if so, he never forgave you.  it's a\n",

      "portrait he did of you?  i don't think i have ever seen it since he\n",

      "sent it down to selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the\n",
      "way.  you never got it back?  what a pity! it was really a\n",
      "masterpiece.  i remember i wanted to buy it.  i wish i had now.  it\n",

      "that had not held the knife.  confess?  did it mean that he was to\n",

      "\n",
